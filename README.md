Super_Boost
===========

This design is inspired by the <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/mintyboost/">Minty Boost</a> but it fixes some of the issues that I had with it. The Minty Boost is limited to 600mA due to the <a href="http://www.linear.com/product/LT1302">LT1302</a> chip. The Super Boost uses the <a href="http://www.national.com/pf/LM/LM2700.html">LM2700</a> which can push up to 3.6A. This will enable i-devices to draw up to there maximum of 1A which will enable a faster recharge. In the LM2700 current configuration it can push 2.3A. This is due to the switching duty cycle of the chip.

Charging more quickly will drain and reduce the life span of AA batteries so lithium batteries are the ideal source for this board. 

The board will take any voltage source between 2.2V to 4.5V and will output 5V.


Board Files are for Cadsoft Eagle V6.0+
